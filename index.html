        <section id="about-me">
            <p>My name is Yrla, I'm 26 and live in Malmö. This is my first time
                creating a webpage so I'm new to this. I have played around 
                with html before when it comes to designing my blog I had when I was
                15 years old. It was nothing serious. 
                On my free time I like to go for walks, take a fika, play video-
                and boardgames and much more. I have so many things I like to do.
            </p>
            <p> So now you know a little more about me, I hope it was fun!</p>
